Play a Tarot game against Fate. From the TED riddle at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIeT1zxsus0

# Rules
- The tarots are numbered 1 - 23
1. You select the number of a tarot; You gain that many points; Remove that tarot from play.
2. Fate takes the tarots of all factors of that number on the board; Fate gains that many points; Remove those tarots from play;
3. Repeat


- In order for you to take a tarot, at least one factor of that tarot must remain on the board
- If you have no valid moves (The remaining tarots don't have their factors still on board), Fate takes all remaining tarots and the game ends
- To win, you must have a higher final score than Fate; Fate wins ties
